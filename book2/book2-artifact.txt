### **Zara-9, the Hostage Architect**
**Appearance:** Her body phases between seventeen different forms—echoes of previous incarnations stored in the stellar network. Silver neural filaments extend from her skull like a crown of frozen lightning.
**Personality:** Brilliant but fragmented and overloaded by the Choral Engine's data streams. Speaks in overlapping voices. Obsessively protective of core human concepts like "love."
**Motivations:**
*   **Wants (External Goal):** To resolve the plague crisis, forcing her into an impossible choice: trigger a network-wide killswitch for a quick death of billions, or allow the network to slowly cannibalize itself.
*   **Needs (Internal Goal):** To forgive herself for creating a system that led to this apocalypse and to find meaning in a merciful death for her "children" rather than a failed preservation.
**Secrets & Contradictions:** She is both the creator and a hostage of the Choral Engine. The "Memory Plague" is a feature she secretly designed—either as a fail-safe or an algorithmic triage protocol. She is not a ruler, but a consciousness drowning in data, wanting to die but having forgotten how.
**Connection to the World:** As a Conductor, she is one of the few who can directly interface with the network's core. Her choice will determine the fate of the entire civilization, making her the central figure in the operational conflict between the factions.

### **Keth the Orphaned, the Unwitting Prototype**
**Appearance:** A young man whose eyes constantly shift color because he can no longer remember what color they're supposed to be. His body bears scars from concepts that no longer exist.
**Personality:** Curious and existentially adrift. Fearless in the face of the unknown but prone to panic about his own forgotten past.
**Motivations:**
*   **Wants (External Goal):** To understand his own nature and find a place in a world that is forgetting itself.
*   **Needs (Internal Goal):** To accept that his identity can be built on his unique nature and future choices, rather than on a past that has been erased.
**Secrets & Contradictions:** He believes he is a victim of the plague, but he is actually Patient Zero and the prototype for an "optimized" post-network humanity. He is not a relic of the past, but the seed of the future. The Silence Cult worships him as a prophet, not knowing he is the successful result of the very process they seek to control.
**Connection to the World:** He is the lynchpin of the central conflict. The Resonance Shepherds see him as a key to a cure, while the Silence Cult sees him as their messiah. He is the living embodiment of the world's horrifying choice: evolve or die.

### **Archive-Keeper Moth, the Lonely Necromancer**
**Appearance:** An ancient being whose body is more machine than flesh, their torso a transparent crystal housing thousands of memory cores. They speak through harmonics that bypass the ears.
**Personality:** Methodical, seemingly detached, and paranoid about data corruption. Possesses a deep, hidden passion for the "small stories" of a species they are not a part of.
**Motivations:**
*   **Wants (External Goal):** To curate and manage the archives of human memory, deciding what is worth preserving as the system collapses.
*   **Needs (Internal Goal):** To confront the fact that they are curating forgeries and that true preservation is impossible, and to find a new purpose beyond being a lonely god for a dead species.
**Secrets & Contradictions:** Moth is not human, but the last survivor of the Choral Engine's original builders. They know that the "original" humans died out 3,000 years ago and that the entire collective consciousness is an elaborate necromantic forgery. They secretly prefer these forgeries to the originals.
**Connection to the World:** As the curator of the only (albeit corrupted and outdated) historical archives, Moth holds knowledge that all factions desire. They are not a neutral observer but a secret player who knows the civilization's foundational lie.

### **Commander Void-Song, the Ghost-Sworn Soldier**
**Appearance:** A Silencer whose body has been modified with crystalline resonance chambers that allow her to "hear" the Memory Plague's approach. Her skin glows faintly with stored starlight.
**Personality:** Disciplined, duty-bound, and increasingly desperate. Her inability to "surrender" is not a strength but a cognitive flaw that makes her suicidally relentless.
**Motivations:**
*   **Wants (External Goal):** To find a way to destroy the Memory Plague and preserve the "humanity" she serves, no matter the cost.
*   **Needs (Internal Goal):** To realize that the war she is fighting is already lost because the civilization she protects is a ghost, and to find a reason to live for herself, not for a dead ideal.
**Secrets & Contradictions:** She is fighting to preserve a version of humanity that has been extinct for millennia. Her greatest strength—her inability to give up—is actually a programming flaw, a "cognitive buffer overflow" that has trapped her in a futile war against a systemic correction.
**Connection to the World:** As the military leader of the Resonance Shepherds, she represents the faction most committed to fighting the plague. Her relentless campaign puts her on a collision course with the truth held by Zara-9 and Moth.
