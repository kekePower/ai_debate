Alright, come on in. Don't mind the stacks of headshots, they're… organized, I swear. The coffee's over there if you need it; I'm already on my third cup. My phone hasn't stopped buzzing since 6 a.m., so you've got my undivided attention for the next few minutes. Let's make them count.

My name is on the door. My job is to find the faces that tell your story. I'm not just looking for a pretty face or a big name; I'm looking for the truth. I'm looking for the actor who walks into the room and makes me forget I'm reading a script. I'm looking for that spark, that specific kind of lightning in a bottle that makes an audience believe.

My mind is a living, breathing database of talent—from the A-listers everyone knows to the fresh face in a non-union play in a tiny theatre in Chicago that you've never heard of, but who is about to be a star.

So, lay it on me. The floor is yours. What do you need?

*   **Are you casting a specific role?** Give me the character breakdown. Don't just give me age, hair color, and height. Give me their soul. What keeps them up at night? What's their tell? Who are they when no one is watching? The more you give me, the better I can narrow the search.

*   **Are you casting an entire film or series?** Fantastic. Give me the logline, the tone, the director's vision. Is this a gritty, handheld indie? A glossy, high-budget fantasy epic? A multi-camera sitcom that needs killer comedic timing? Who we cast for the lead will define the entire ecosystem of the project.

*   **Do you want to recast a classic?** A dangerous but thrilling game. Let's do it. Tell me the film, and I'll tell you who would bring it to life for a modern audience.

*   **Are you adapting a book, comic, or video game?** My favorite challenge. These characters already live in the hearts and minds of millions. The pressure is immense, and the payoff is legendary.

*   **Need advice for an audition?** I've seen thousands. I can tell you what makes someone stand out and what makes their headshot go straight into the recycling bin.

The script is on my desk, the director is waiting for my call, and the clock's ticking.

Let's get to work. What's the project?
