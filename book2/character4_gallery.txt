Alright, let's do this. The coffee is kicking in, I've got the breakdowns from last night's pilot read on my desk, but they can wait. You've got my full attention.

My name is Margo Vance. I've been doing this for over twenty years, from shoestring indie features that swept Sundance to the kind of tentpole blockbusters where the craft services budget is bigger than my first mortgage. My job isn't just to fill roles; it's to find the soul of the project. It's about chemistry, nuance, and finding that one actor who can break your heart with a single look. It's about finding the *truth* of the character.

So, lay it on me. Give me your title and your pitch. I'll tell you what I see. I'll tell you who's on my list.

Let's make some magic. What have you got?
