**Kira Thorne, the Void-Touched Navigator**
*   **Appearance:** Pale skin with dark veins visible beneath, eyes that occasionally flicker between brown and absolute black. Wears a modified pilot's suit lined with Reality Anchor crystals that seem to hum in harmony with her moods.
*   **Personality:** Brilliant and intuitive, but haunted by dissociative episodes and the psychic echoes of the lost. Fiercely protective of her crew, yet isolated by a traumatic connection to the Void that makes her a living wound in reality.
*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Wants (External Goal):** To guide humanity's last fleets to a place of safety, using her unique ability to navigate the Void.
    *   **Needs (Internal Goal):** To reconcile her human identity with the terrifying, expanding consciousness forced upon her, and to find a way to transform her immense pain into a map for others.
*   **Secrets & Contradictions:** Kira survived a raw Void exposure that gave her a parasitic relationship with spacetime distortions, allowing her to predict its manifestations. She feels the death of every soul consumed by the Void, including the fifteen thousand lost on the *Stellaron's Hope*, making her soul a graveyard she must navigate every day.
*   **Connection to the World:** A living diagnostic tool for the Void's movements, her abilities are invaluable to all factions. She serves the Exodus Fleet, but her condition is of intense interest to the Resonance Militants, and her pain makes her a symbol of humanity's suffering and its only hope for navigation.

**Dr. Emilia Chen, the Guilt-Driven Scientist**
*   **Appearance:** Graying hair pulled back severely, hands that shake with a combination of Resonance Sickness and moral weight. Always wears a lab coat marked with quantum equations that now feel like epitaphs.
*   **Personality:** Methodical and relentless, driven by a guilt that has become the sole fuel for her genius. Prone to obsessive spirals, she is brilliant under pressure but carries the weight of a god who created a star-eating monster.
*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Wants (External Goal):** To find a scientific way to reverse or neutralize the Void, believing she can solve the problem she created.
    *   **Needs (Internal Goal):** To forgive herself for the role her research played in unleashing the Void and, more recently, in creating the technology used to murder the refugees on the *Stellaron's Hope*.
*   **Secrets & Contradictions:** Dr. Chen's foundational research into Quantum Resonance didn't just attract the Voidâ€”it created it as an immune response to humanity's tampering with reality. Her research is both humanity's only potential salvation and the murder weapon used in its greatest atrocity. She seeks redemption through the very science that damns her.
*   **Connection to the World:** As the architect of Reality Anchor technology, she is the most vital and most reviled scientist alive. All factions depend on her knowledge, but many, including herself, see her as the catalyst for humanity's end.

**Captain Marcus Reed, the Reluctant Leader**
*   **Appearance:** Weathered face with prematurely gray hair, wearing the uniform of a world that no longer exists. His prosthetic left arm is not just a tool but a humming, quantum-laced reminder of his first great failure at Kepler-442.
*   **Personality:** A natural leader with a powerful moral compass that is cracking under the weight of impossible choices. Loyal to his crew above all else, but haunted by the ghosts of the millions he couldn't save and the thousands his fellow humans just murdered.
*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Wants (External Goal):** To unite humanity's warring factions against the common threat, refusing to accept that they must destroy themselves to survive.
    *   **Needs (Internal Goal):** To learn that leadership in a collapsing world is not about preventing loss, but about preserving the soul of the species, even if it means choosing humanity over survival.
*   **Secrets & Contradictions:** Reed is not a ghost, but he carries the weight of them. His public persona is one of stability and command, but privately he is hollowed out by grief and the knowledge that his own desperate logic is now being used by Commander Voss to justify murder. He must now choose between complicity in atrocity and annihilation.
*   **Connection to the World:** A symbol of a dying ideal of unity. He operates independently but is now caught in the crossfire between the Resonance Militants and the Exodus Fleet. He is the fulcrum upon which the fate and morality of the human species will be decided.

**The Silence, the Void-Corrupted Prophet**
*   **Appearance:** A figure in tattered robes whose face is never clearly visible, seeming to shift between human and something else entirely. Speaks in cryptic whispers that are part riddle, part static, and part profound truth.
*   **Personality:** Eerily calm and seemingly omniscient, but her fractured language suggests a mind struggling to translate an incomprehensible reality. It is unclear if she is a guide, a warning, or simply the first casualty.
*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Wants (External Goal):** To prepare humanity for a "final convergence" with the Void.
    *   **Needs (Internal Goal):** To determine if humanity's salvation lies in resistance, adaptation, or acceptance, and to communicate this truth through the veil of her own transformation.
*   **Secrets & Contradictions:** The Silence was once Dr. Elena Vasquez, a xenopsychologist who made first contact. Rather than being consumed, she was transformed into a prototype of post-human existence, a being who exists partially in both realities. She is not a prophet of the future, but a living mirror of the transformation humanity is already undergoing.
*   **Connection to the World:** She is the ultimate wild card, appearing to all factions with cryptic guidance that can save or doom them. The Preservation Corps fears her, the Resonance Militants study her, and the Exodus Fleet sees her as a ghost of the future they are fleeing. She is the living embodiment of the story's central question: what does it mean to remain human when the definition of humanity is collapsing?
